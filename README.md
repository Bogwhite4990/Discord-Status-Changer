It is an executable that allows you to change your discord status automatically. It is the first version so bugs will be found in the application.You can set a custom message to appear as a status, it also has a surprise effect where each letter appears in turn to create a more beautiful effect. If you don’t want a status set by you and want a status according to the weather you can choose the weather status option.

How to use it ?

Downlaod the file.
Unzip the file.
Open main.exe

Discord API: Here you need to put your discord token. Here you can find the tutorial on how to find the discord token: – LINK (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI) .

Set Status: Only if you want to use a status written by you must write something here, if you want to use the weather as a status you don’t have to write anything here.

Login: The system determines if the token from discord is correct or not and notifies the user.

5. If you have done everything correctly and your discord token is correct then a new window should open.

Delay: My recommendation is to leave on 3 because the lower you put the more chances you have to get banned on discord.The higher the number, the safer it is, but the letters that appear in the status will also appear more slowly.

START: If you don’t want to use the weather as a status then you can press start and watch the program automatically change the status.

If you want to use the weather as a status

Check ‘Use Weather for your status’

First you need the Openweathermap API and you can find it by following this tutorial: LINK
At Longitude you need to put your city longitude.
At Latitude you need to put your city latitude.
Simply google city name coordinates. Ex: ‘new york coordinates’

SAVE: This button will save all your information to a file so you don’t have to write it down every time you enter the program.

START:Now with the status option depending on the weather you will see in the status what kind of weather is in your city. Ex:
